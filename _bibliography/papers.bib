  title={Capstone - Explore Quantum Teleportation Algorithms with Cloud-based Quantum Computers},

  abstract={This project focuses on the cutting-edge quantum computation algorithm, quantum teleportation, and prepare the ground for using quantum Internet to solve distributed system problems. The 3-qubit on-chip quantum teleportation algorithm is simulated and implemented with IBM quantum processor with post selection, customized state preparation and 4 different corrections. Fidelity is used as measurement methods to analyze the performance.},
