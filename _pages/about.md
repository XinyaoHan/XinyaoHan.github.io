<!-- My name is Xinyao Han. I am a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics/">Master of Bussiness Analytics</a> student at  Sloan School of Management. I graduated from NYU Shanghai with a major in Computer Science.

In case you don't know, I am a little kitty and I like to eat seafood very much. At my leisure time, I only nap and procrastinate. Also my biggest hobby is to play with my little puppy who is so nice, kind, warmhearted, good-looking, humorous, smart, and understanding.

By the way, I am also looking for jobs and I can catch mice and play with myself. I try hard not to mess with your furnitures and keep you a clean home. For a recent resume, click [here](/assets/pdf/XinyaoHan_resume_1205.pdf). -->

I’m a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics/">Bussiness Analytics</a> student at MIT. Before that, I studied Computer Science for my undergrad at <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/">New York University in Shanghai</a> and Abu Dhabi campus.

I am skilled in Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Probability and Statistics, and Deep Learning. I love seeing the world through a quantitative lens and solving real-world problems that make a positive impact.
