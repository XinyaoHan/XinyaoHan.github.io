My name is Xinyao Han. I am a MBAn student at MIT Sloan School of Management. I graduated from NYU Shanghai with a major in Computer Science.

In case you don't know, I am a little kitty and I like to eat seafood very much. At my leisure time, I only nap and procrastinate. Also my biggest hobby is to play with my little puppy who is so nice, kind, warmhearted, good-looking, humorous, smart, and understanding.

By the way, I am also looking for jobs and I can catch mice and play with myself. I try hard not to mess with your furnitures and keep you a clean home. For a recent resume, click [here](/assets/pdf/XinyaoHan_resume_1205.pdf).
