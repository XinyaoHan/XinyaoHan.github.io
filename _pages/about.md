<!-- My name is Xinyao Han. I am a <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics/">Master of Bussiness Analytics</a> student at  Sloan School of Management. I graduated from NYU Shanghai with a major in Computer Science.

In case you don't know, I am a little kitty and I like to eat seafood very much. At my leisure time, I only nap and procrastinate. Also my biggest hobby is to play with my little puppy who is so nice, kind, warmhearted, good-looking, humorous, smart, and understanding.

By the way, I am also looking for jobs and I can catch mice and play with myself. I try hard not to mess with your furnitures and keep you a clean home. For a recent resume, click [here](/assets/pdf/XinyaoHan_resume_1205.pdf). -->

Hello! I study <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics/">Bussiness Analytics</a> at MIT. Before that, I studied Computer Science for my undergrad at New York University in <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/">Shanghai</a> and Abu Dhabi campus.

I'm a proactive learner, woman in tech, storyteller with data. I love seeing the world through a quantitative lens and the circumspect establishment of data evidence through substantively and statistically principled modeling results. I desire to create value by analyzing underexplored data. I enjoy solving real-world problems that make a positive impact.

To stay abreast with evolving techniques, I continuously explore cutting-edge models through advanced research and internships. I'm interested in machine learning, optimization, data analytics and data-driven decisions. I am skilled in Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Probability and Statistics, and NLP.
